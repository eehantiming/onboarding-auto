# 3 Scrum Practices
1. We adopt an agile approach to our software projects, which focuses on delivering product in small increments. We follow the scrum method, read more about them [here](https://www.coursera.org/articles/agile-vs-scrum).
2. The sprint cycle and other details specific to our team are summarized in [this deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aR7JePEHx4gYAbG01M4Eg-wlql1K-K_f/edit#slide=id.p1) of slides. Read through and note down any questions that you have. 
3. All devs on the team are automatically part of the scrum team. The latest schedule is maintained on a shared google calendar by the scrummasters, ask a friendly teammate to share this calendar with your gmail :)
4. Join in the next sprint activity!
